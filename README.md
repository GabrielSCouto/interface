# Clinical AI Support Interface for CISAM/UPE

This project is a highly customized fork of [Open WebUI](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui), specifically adapted for a healthcare AI initiative at the **Centro Integrado de Sa√∫de Amaury de Medeiros (CISAM)**, a reference hospital of the University of Pernambuco (UPE) in Brazil.

The platform transforms the general-purpose UI into a secure, specialized, and intuitive interface designed to support clinicians, residents, and researchers in the fields of Women's Health, High-Risk Obstetrics, and Neonatology. It serves as the primary frontend for interacting with specialized, locally-hosted Large Language Models (LLMs).

## üéØ Project Mission

Our goal is to augment the capabilities of healthcare professionals by providing a powerful AI assistant that understands the specific clinical context of CISAM. We aim to improve efficiency, support clinical decision-making, and enhance medical training, all within a secure, on-premises environment that guarantees patient data privacy.

## ‚ú® Key Features & Modifications

* **üîí Enhanced Security & Compliance:**
    * Designed for **on-premises deployment** to ensure that sensitive patient data never leaves the hospital's secure infrastructure.
    * Built-in data anonymization features and strict access control mechanisms to comply with data protection regulations like LGPD (Brazil's General Data Protection Law).

* **ü©∫ Specialized AI Assistant:**
    * Interacts with fine-tuned LLMs trained on medical literature and protocols relevant to Gynecology, Obstetrics, and Neonatology.
    * Provides support for differential diagnoses, reviews clinical guidelines, and suggests up-to-date scientific literature.

* **üìä Clinical Decision Support:**
    * Enables the analysis of **anonymized** clinical data to identify patterns in high-risk pregnancies, rare gynecological conditions, or neonatal complications.
    * Acts as a qualified "second opinion" to support complex medical evaluations.

* **‚úçÔ∏è Documentation & Workflow Optimization:**
    * Tools for summarizing patient records, generating draft reports, and organizing clinical notes.
    * Frees up valuable time for healthcare professionals to focus on direct patient care.

* **üéì Training & Simulation Environment:**
    * Provides a safe, interactive space for medical residents and students to explore complex clinical cases.
    * Enhances the learning process with AI-driven feedback and scenarios.

* **üìö Integrated Knowledge Base:**
    * Offers contextual and fast access to a curated database of medical guidelines, institutional protocols from CISAM, and key research papers.
